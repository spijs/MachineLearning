\section{Abstract}

In this assignment it is necessary to be able to detect which person is walking around with a phone.
This detection will be based on previously labeled data, generated by people walking with their phone.
The detection is done by extracting useful features for each of the given walks and then applying Machine Learning techniques on this data.
Our solution provides a command line based user interface which offers a lot of options and flexibility. The results generated by this solution however do not offer a high accuracy.
