\section{Conclusion}
By using the information we found in the papers of our previous lecture study, we were able to tackle most of the questions we posed. We found solutions for  creating windows, extracting 42 features and filtering corrupt windows. We were able to make classifications for the windows and join them back together for each walk. A cross-validation method was implement to assess the accuracy. However it showed that the results of these classifications were not as good as expected. Most classifiers tend to classify all walks as \textit{Other} so for those classifiers we expect the predictions for the unseen walks to be erronous.
